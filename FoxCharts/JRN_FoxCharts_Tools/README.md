# JRN_FoxCharts_Tools
### By Jim Nelson

This toolkit contains a couple of add-on tools not part of FoxCharts proper:

*	VisualChartDesigner – a tool which allows either the developer or an end user to make changes to the FoxCharts properties and see their immediate effect.  VisualChartDesigner can be added to any existing chart by adding a single control to the FoxCharts container of an chart, cmdChartOptions of VISUALCHARTDESIGNER.VCX.
*	GetChartDataFromRows – a PRG to convert data series which originates in rows into the format that FoxCharts requires (where each data series is in a field).

The JRN_FoxCharts_Tools folder contains the following items:

*	VisualChartDesigner.VCX
*	GetChartDataFromRows.PRG
*	A Documentation folder, which contains a separate document for each of the tools.
*	A Samples folder, which contains VisualChartDesigner_Sample.SCX
*	An additional form and class; you will not reference either of these, but both are used by the VisualChartDesigner.
