## JRN FoxCharts Tools

This toolkit contains a couple of add-on tools not part of FoxCharts proper:
* **VisualChartDesigner**: a tool which allows either the developer or an end user to make changes to the FoxCharts properties and see their immediate effect. VisualChartDesigner can be added to any existing chart by adding a single control to the FoxCharts container of a chart: cmdChartOptions of VisualChartDesigner.vcx
* **GetChartDataFromRows**: a PRG to convert data series which originates in rows into the format that FoxCharts requires (where each data series is in a field).

![](img/FoxCharts%20Tools_VisualChartDesigner.png)

The JRN_FoxCharts_Tools folder contains the following items:
* VisualChartDesigner.VCX
* GetChartDataFromRows.PRG
* A Documentation folder, which contains a separate document for each of the tools.
* A Samples folder, which contains VisualChartDesigner_Sample.SCX
* An additional form and class; you will not reference either of these, but both are used by the VisualChartDesigner.

## Beta Update

*New features:*
* Introduced new Bar Types: Cone, Conoid, Pyramid and truncated pyramid (Frustum).
* Introduced new Brush Types: HatchBrush Color, Textures Brush
* Right-clicking on the SideLegends in the chart, can call a new form that allows you to interactively apply changes to the way the side legends appear. You can change the Legend positions, colors, and other character formatting.

*New properties:*
* GradientShapeDirection: Numeric, determines the Gradient Brush direction (0-3).
* GradientVertCount and GradientHorCount: Numeric, determines the Shape Gradient Brush stripes count (vertical and horizontal)

*Fixes:*  
Fix in "System.app". The distributed version avoids some bugs due to LOCAL variables declarations inside TRY/CATCH. May work faster in local net.

*VERY IMPORTANT:*  
Since this new version brings several modifications, the new and current Beta version is a subclass of the original and latest FoxCharts version v1.37. The new class is in the Foxcharts1.46_Beta folder, named FoxChartsBeta.vcx.

All new samples, the ones that will benefit from the newest features, are in the SamplesBeta folder.

Start playing with the ChartsSample_ArrowsInLegend.scx form.
- Change the spinner values to see the new charts available
- Click on the Side Legends, to see cool stripes 
- Right-click the over the SideLegends to call the new SideLegends form, and play with the new possibilities!
