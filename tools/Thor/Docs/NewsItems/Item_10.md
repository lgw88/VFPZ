The new VFPX project [FoxcodePlus (Beta 1)](https://github.com/VFPX/FoxcodePlus) is available from Check For Updates.

This project is ***not*** related to IntellisenseX, another VFPX project, although both provide Intellisense enhancements. FoxCodePlus provides a wider range of features and includes some of the features provided by IntellisenseX. Although not yet tested, it appears that the two may be used concurrently.

After downloading (which includes both the code and documentation), you can use the Thor menu pad in the system menu to open the folder in which these components are installed:
