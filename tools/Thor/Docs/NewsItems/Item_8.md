#### <a name="Headline8">#8, 2012-09-30</a>

IntellisenseX has been released as a VFPX project.

*IntellisenseX* refers to a suite of Thor Tools that provide functionality similar to native Intellisense. These tools display lists of available variable names, field names, or members (properties, events, methods, and objects) while you type code, just like Intellisense. However, they cover those areas that Intellisense forgot (such as the list of field names in a table when editing in a code window) and provide8ew capabilities, available through customization, such as displaying the list of field names in an SQL table.

Visit the [IntellisenseX home page](https://github.com/VFPX/IntelliSenseX) and also watch the [Intellisense training videos](https://github.com/VFPX/IntelliSenseX#videos). <!-- TBL video -->

IntellisenseX is available from Check For Updates. <!-- TBL -->

All VFPX projects can be downloaded from Thor.
