The Thor menu has been changed to provide access to a number of related Discussion Forums.

These forums are the preferred form of communication about these tools, rather than private emails, or using the Universal Thread, Foxite, or any other on-line forums.

Change logs for the various tools and components of Thor are now available, as well as a link to the never ending list of Thor ERs.
