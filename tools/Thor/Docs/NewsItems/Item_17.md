The new VFPX project *Finder* is a powerful search tool to find forms and classes. It searches either a project or folder (with sub-folders) for names of files or classes.

Files or classes can be opened by double-clicking and there are numerous other options available from the context menu for rows in the grid.

When Class Search is used, the classes found can be dragged/dropped onto forms or classes being edited.

See the [Finder Home Page](https://github.com/VFPX/Finder) and watch the [Finder introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL4a9gsCLlk) (11:25).
