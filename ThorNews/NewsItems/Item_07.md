The current version of all VFPX projects can now be downloaded directly from Check For Updates. <!-- TBL -->

The projects listed in Check For Updates are listed alphabetically within these five groups:
1. Projects that you have already downloaded for which there is a more current version. (see #4)
1. Projects that you have not downloaded which have had updates in the last three months
1. All other projects that you have not downloaded
1. Projects that you have already downloaded and which are current
1. All projects marked as “never update”.  This takes precedence over any of the categories above.
