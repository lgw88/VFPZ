# fxReports / Feature Repository
<b>Repository of reporting features provided by the FoxPro Community</b><br><br>
Project Manager: [Cathy Pountney](https://github.com/frontier2000)<br>

<b>NOTE TO CONSUMERS</b><br>
Each contributor provides all the individual files in a subfolder (named after themselves.) In addition, an all-inclusive zip file is  provided. Either download the zip file or the individual files, but not both. Use the Unwrap & Share utility (located in the CoreFramework folder) to process files you download. 

<b>NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS</b><br>
Each developer who contributes reporting features has a uniquely named folder (named after themselves). Use the Wrap & Share Utility (located in the CoreFramework folder) to prepare your files and then upload them to your subfolder. Note that within your folder, the following subfolders may exist:
<ul>
<li>code</li>
<li>samples</li>
<li>docs</li>
<li>data (mandatory)</li>
</ul>

Upload the .ZIP file to the FeatureRepository folder.

Update the TOC.md file to describe each of the features you provide.

<i>NOTE: I'm preparing this framework and utilities as a presentation scheduled for [Southwest Fox 2019](www.swfox.net). Look for more to come soon.<i>
