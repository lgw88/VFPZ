### Bookmarks (or, if you prefer, bread crumbs)

Tool [Go To Definition](https://github.com/VFPX/GoToDefinition) (**GTD**) creates bookmarks each time it is used, one placed where **GTD** was invoked and one at its destination (if in a code window).  Two Thor tools work with these bookmarks:
* **Cycle Bookmarks** takes you through all your current bookmarks.
* **Add/Remove BookMark** will add a bookmark at the current location if there isn't one there or remove the current bookmark if there is.

These two can be used in combination without even using **GTD**.
    
Note that bookmarks are defined by the window (not its contents) and the cursor position in that window.  They are automatically removed when the window is closed.  Also, they may be out of sync if the code above the bookmark cursor position in the window has been modified.
