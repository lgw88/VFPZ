# Control Renamer Builder

**Builder designed to rename controls and reference to controls in the method codes .**

Project Manager: Tamar E. Granor

The Control Renamer Builder provides a solution to working with existing forms and classes where controls have their default (or other meaningless) names. This builder allows you to specify meaningful names for controls on the form or class and updates both the controls themselves and any method code.
