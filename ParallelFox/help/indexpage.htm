<div class="contentbody">ParallelFox is a parallel processing library for Visual FoxPro 9.0 and part of the VFPx project.<p>Although parallel processing and multi-threading have been possible in VFP for quite some time (particularly in web servers), the goal of this project is the same as parallel processing libraries that have been popping up for other development platforms. That is, to make parallel processing easier and more approachable, without all of the headaches typically associated with multi-threaded programming. This has become more important as multi-core desktop and server machines have become widespread.<p>Download the latest release of ParallelFox on VFPx: <a href="http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ParallelFox">http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ParallelFox</a>
