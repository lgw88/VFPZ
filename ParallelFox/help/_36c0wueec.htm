<div class="contentbody">Follow these instructions to deploy ParallelFox with your application:<p><ul><li>     Include ParallelFox.vcx in your project.<br><li>     Typically, your worker code will be compiled into your main app/exe.  However, if you choose to create a separate app/exe for your worker code, include ParallelFox.vcx in that project as well.<br><li>     ParallelFox.exe should be installed and registered. This is an EXE, so RegSvr32 does not work with it. If your install program doesn't handle it, register by executing ParallelFox.exe /regserver.  <b>NOTE:</b> Registering ParallelFox requires elevation on Windows Vista/7. Without elevation, ParallelFox.exe /regserver will fail, but it will not notify the user of the failure! Your installation package will likely have already requested elevation, so this shouldn't be a problem.  If you will be using FoxPro code to register ParallelFox, see INSTALL.PRG for an example of how to handle this.<br></ul>
