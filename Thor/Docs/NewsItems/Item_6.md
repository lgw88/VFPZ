Use the “Community / Discussions” menu item in the Thor menu pad to send comments, suggestions, bug reports, and so on to the [Thor Discussion Group](http://groups.google.com/group/FoxProThor). You are invited to become a member of the group so that you can see what is going on in the land of Thor.
