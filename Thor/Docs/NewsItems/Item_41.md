Two new projects have been added to VFPX and are available from Check For Updates.

* [ThemedTitleBar](https://github.com/VFPX/ThemedTitleBar) -- The TitleBar of a VFP form displayed ‘In Screen’ or ‘In Top-Level Form’ looks a bit outdated nowadays, at least running in Win8 and compared to Office 2013 or Visual Studio 2013. The goal of this project is to provide a modern drop-in replacement for the default TitleBar, requiring no code changes to existing forms.
* [VFP 9 SP2 Hotfix 3 Download](https://github.com/VFPX/VFP9SP2Hotfix3) is the most recent hotfix for VFP 9 SP2. The hotfix includes all three hotfixes released for VFP 9 SP2
