Thor’s Tool Launcher uses a simple screen that allows you to browse through all the Thor tools by keyword, to read their descriptions or visit their home pages, to set their options, and, most importantly, to run them. It also helps you to organize the tools that you use most to make them easily accessible.

Thor suffers from an over-abundance of tools – there are so many that it may seem impossible to find which tools are of interest to you. The Tool Launcher simplifies that search.
