The fourth page (**Options**) of the Thor form provides for a few option settings.  To change a setting, click on the row on the left, and the appropriate controls will appear on the right.

The first options bears some explanation.  

The mechanism used by Thor to provide hot keys that use two or more shift keys (Shift, Ctrl, and Alt) requires the use of one dedicated key that is created by On Key Label.  The default for this key is Alt+F12.

The first option allows you to change that hot key.  Be aware that it must be a key that can be defined by On Key Label, so it can use only one of Shift, Ctrl, and Alt.  Furthermore, the On Key Label definition of the previous hot key will not have been removed, so it is recommended that you close your VFP session immediately after changing the dedicated hot key.
