Installing an updated version of Thor
===

To install an updated version of Thor, simply unzip the installation zip file on top of the current version of Thor.  

Do ***not*** install Thor in a new folder or erase the Thor sub-folder, as you will lose any menus, hot keys, etc, that you have created.  

This will replace Thor.APP, and will not modify or delete any of the settings and tools that you have installed.  

Any updates necessary for the new version will be automatically installed the first time that you run Thor thereafter,
