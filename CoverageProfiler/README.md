# Coverage Profiler
The Visual FoxPro Coverage Profiler is provided in two parts, a Coverage engine object you can use or customize and a multiple window application you can use to analyze programs and projects. The Coverage Profiler application (Coverage.app) provides several ways to view the data provided by the Coverage engine. Coverage.app is a subclass of the Coverage engine class. You can automate coverage or modify the user interface to suit your needs, run Coverage.app in unattended mode and not display the application window, or use engine features without using the interface.

Coverage Profiler is part of [XSource](https://github.com/VFPX/XSource), the source files for various Visual FoxPro components. The license governing XSource can be found in the XSource_EULA.txt included with all of the XSource releases.
