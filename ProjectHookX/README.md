# ProjectHookX

**Project Manager**: Toni M. Feltman

Visual FoxPro projecthooks were released back in version 6.0. The projecthook class allows VFP developers the ability to write code in response to events fired while working with the Project Manager. This allows developers to extend the functionality of the Project Manager and automate tasks associated to the development of a project. The design of a traditional projecthook follows the Microsoft's initial intentions of one projecthook for one project. The ProjectHookX project builds and extends this concept using the hook pattern so multiple projecthooks are associated to a project.
