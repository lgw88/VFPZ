# XSource

Microsoft's Visual FoxPro XSource is made up of the source in the XSource.zip of the XSource folder in the Visual FoxPro \Tools directory.

XSource contains the source files for various Visual FoxPro components. The license governing XSource can be found in the XSource_EULA.txt included with all of the XSource releases

For the purposes of maintaining XSource, VFPX splits it into 21 main projects. Some of the projects may contain a collection of smaller projects, such as Builders and Wizards.
