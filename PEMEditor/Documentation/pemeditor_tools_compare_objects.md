### IDE Tools: Compare with copied object

This tool compares all the properties and methods in the copied object (see [Copy properties and method code](pemeditor_tools_copy.md)) with those in the current object.

The listing shows all non-identical properties or methods.

*   Non-default properties or methods are shown in grey. 
*   Missing properties or methods appear with a grey background.

The following shows a comparison between two different objects of the same baseclass, but differing classes.
