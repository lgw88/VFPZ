### IDE Tools: Modify Super Class

This feature assists you in opening the parent class of an object for editing.

You are presented with a form such as is shown below, which shows the entire parentage of the object, including classes and super classes:

As the directions on the form indicate, you must then:

1.  Save or close the form or class you are working on (since you cannot open a parent class if you didn’t)
2.  And select the parent class (double-clicking will work.)

Note that this form remains open after you have selected a class or super class.  This allows you to continue to navigate between <u>any</u> of the classes as well as allowing you to return to the original class or form you were editing.
