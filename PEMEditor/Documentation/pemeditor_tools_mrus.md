### IDE Tools: MRUs

This tool pops up a menu of eight eight different MRU lists, as you can see here.

MRUs are the forgotten step-child of FoxPro, but this tool makes them more accessible, and other tools have dramatically increased the number of places that keep the MRU lists up to date.  **See [Managing MRU lists and Source Code Control](pemeditor_tools_mru_notes.md)**

These lists are the same as are created and used in the Command Window, and are stored in your resource file.

Note the addition of one new list, ***not*** maintained by FoxPro: Class Libraries.
