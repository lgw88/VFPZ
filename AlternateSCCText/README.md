# Alternate SCCText
**Improved source code control to text program for use with Visual FoxPro's IDE.**

Project Manager: [JÃ¼rgen Wondzinski](https://github.com/Woody-Soft), aka "wOOdy"

This new and improved version of the source code control to text program was developed years ago by ProLib and released for all Visual FoxPro developers to have a better source code control experience.

There are several improvements made to the original SCCText.prg included in Visual FoxPro:

* Consistent and case insensitive sorting of methods, objects, and properties
* Corrects several bugs in the original version shipped from Microsoft
* Optimizations
* German, Spanish and French localizations

This routine has been in the Fox Community for many years now and is accepted as the "better standard" by Fox developers around the world.
