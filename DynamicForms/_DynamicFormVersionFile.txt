Dynamic Forms is a new way to create forms based on a "markup syntax" similar to HTML and XAML, in which you specify both the layout and ControlSources for the various controls to be displayed on the form.

The result will be a dynamically constructed form, specified in code, rather than manually creating it in the Form Designer.

== Ver 1.9.1 (2017-08-30)
*-- Fixed spelling, capitalization, formatting (no functional changes).

== Ver 1.9.0 (2017-08-27)
*-- Production release, Migrated from VFPx/CodePlex to GitHub

== Ver 1.8.2 Beta Release (2014-09-29)

=== Ver 1.7.0 Alpha (2013-10-31)
*-- 1. Added oRenderOrder colleciton to each Field in the oFieldList so the attributes
*--    will be applied to each rendered conrtol in the same order as they appear in the markup.

=== Ver 1.6.1 Alpha (2012-12-31)
*-- 1. Added a new UI class which can handle pop-up editing of memo fields via DoubleClicking.
*--    See class:  DF_MemoFieldEditBox
*-- 2. Added code to cBodyMarkup_Assign() to store passed value onto form property.
*-- 3. Adjusted ParseField() method so it would not consider "dot" when picking out ControlSource from passed markup.
*--    It breaks on whitespace/newline only.
*-- 4. An object reference to the Render Engine is now added to the passed Container. This is helpful for advanced new features in DF.


=== Ver 1.6.0 Alpha (2012-12-31)
*-- 1. Added new handling for memo fields when binding to fields in a cursor. DF will now render an editbox for
*--     memo fields on a cursor unless a specific class is specified in the markup.
*-- 2. DF will now attempt to open the table if cAlias table is not already open.
*-- 3. Cleaned up the markup in the default footer layout.

=== Ver 1.5.0 Alpha (2012-10-28)
*-- Added new handling which will automatically detect which delimiters are used in the cBodyMarkup
*-- (  :attribute => value   or   .attribute = value )
*-- Revised all markup samples to use . and =, rather than : and =>
*-- Render Engine: Added new property lResizeContainer (default = .f.). By default, the Render Engine does
*-- not resize oContainer to fit rendered control. Dynamic Form overrides this property to .t. as it wants
*-- the container resized to fit controls.
*-- Render Engine: Renamed method ResizeMainContainer() to ResizeContainer()
*-- Render Engine: Added oRenderEngine as an object to ParseField() doesn't have to create a new instance
*-- each time it is called.

=== Ver 1.4.1 Alpha (2012-10-26)
*-- Fixed a bug when assigning :left attribute with a string value

=== Ver 1.4.0 Alpha (2012-10-23)
*-- All Form, Render Engine, and Container properties can now be set in the cBodyMarkup block.
*-- Form.Render() will now accept the cBodyMarkup as a paramter. i.e.: loForm.Render(lcBodyMarkup)
*-- Fixed bug which prevented was overriding :width setting if markup resulted in a DF_ErrorContainer control to show an error condition.

=== Ver 1.3.0 Alpha	 (2012-10-08)
*-- Added support in the markup syntax for including code lines to be executed druing render. Simply wrap code statement in parentheses.
*-- Added support for keeping Modeless forms alive. See Show() method documentation on http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Dynamic%20Forms%20Properties
*-- Added properties lInHeader and lInBody (already had lInFooter) to track which area the render engine is working in. See BuildMarkup().
*-- Refactored some code out of Render() method into new BuildMarkup() method.
*-- BuildMarkup() injects some embedded code to indicate the rendering area (Header, Body, Footer).
*-- Added property for oBusinessObject and cBusinessObjectSaveMethod. See http://vfpx.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Using%20Dynamic%20Forms%20with%20Business%20Objects
*-- Revised Save button to call the Business Object Save method, if everything is assigned.
*-- Added better handling for cSkipFields list.

=== Ver 1.2.0 Alpha	 (2012-09-25)
*-- Added support for new :set-focus => .t. attribute, which indicates which control will have focus when form is shown.
*-- Improved support for :anchor settings on rendered controls. Code changed in ResizeMainContainer() method.
*-- Restored ability to display all fields on cAlias or oDataObject if no cBodyMarkup is specified. See GetBodyMarkupForAll() and Render().
*-- Added new property lInFooter to indicate when the rendering has entered the footer area. This property is set in the Footer markup and is used
*-- in processing to ensure the footer controls will be rendered at the proper vertical location.

=== Ver 1.1.0 Alpha	 (2012-09-23)
*-- Default Footer is now anchored to bottom right of form.
*-- Can now include single lines of FoxPro code in markup to execute at render time. Wrap code code in ( ).
*-- Adjusted vertical spacing of controls DF_HorizontalLine, CommandButtons, CheckBoxes, Pictures
*-- Added class property for new vertical spacing listed above.
*-- Fixed bug when MinHeight and MinWidth are set to a size larger than the render container.
*-- Fixed bug which did not handle Modeless form mode when calling loForm.Show(0)
*-- Added new properties nLastControlLeft, nLastControlBottom, nLastControlRight

=== Ver 1.0.0 Alpha	 (2012-09-18)
* The markup parser now allows attribute values to omit the surrounding quote marks around numeric and Boolean values.
* Another changed in the markup parser is that expressions used as attribute values (which are evaluated run-time), must now be wrapped in parentheses.
* (Credit to Jim Nelson for supplying these parser updates.)
* New properties on the Render Engine allow you to specify custom delimiter patterns for cAttributeNameDelimiterPattern and cAttributeValueDelimiterPattern.


=== Ver 0.9.033	 (2012-09-12)
* Removed Button Bar controls from Form, replaced with cHeaderMarkup and cFooterMarkup.
* cHeaderMarkup and cFooterMarkup are default markup strings which wrap around cBodyMarkup
* to create the entire form. Either cHeaderMarkup and cFooterMarkup can be set to empty to
* prevent them from being added to user supplied cBodyMarkup. They can also be overridden
* by the developer to create custom Header and Footer markup layouts.
* Also added cHeading and cHeadingFontSize which used by cHearderMarkup to create a title on the form.
