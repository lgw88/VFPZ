# NET4COM

The NET4COM library is a collection of COM classes that wrap a subset of the .NET Framework 2.0. The .NET Framework is a rich collection of namespaces and API that provides a comprehensive set of functionality that developers can use to build applications that run on the .NET platform. While VFP does have a rich library of API, there are some features that either do not exist in the VFP libraries or are harder to use than in the Framework. NET4COM brings together a small subset of the .NET Framework &mdash; a collection of commonly used API that brings to VFP functionality that does not exist.

The NET4COM folder contains the following:

* NET4COM.dll: The DLL for the COM components that wrap a subset of the .NET Framework 2.0.

* Source: Folder containing project file and source code for NET4COM

* VFPSamples: Folder containing VFP sample code that uses NET4COM

* VB6Samples: Folder containing VB6 sample code that uses NET4COM

* FFC: FFC wrappers for NET4COM

The samples demonstrate use of NET4COM from Visual FoxPro or Visual Basic 6.0.

NET4COM is part of [Sedna](https://github.com/VFPX/Sedna), a collection of libraries, samples and add-ons to Visual FoxPro 9.0 SP2.
