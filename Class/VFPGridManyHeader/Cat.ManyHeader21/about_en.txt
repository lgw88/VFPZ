What is the ManyHeader ?
1. Allow 2 of headers per column. These custom headers can also be merged with one another
2. Provide a more intuitive operation and interface for the grid¡¯s lock columns feature
3. Address the flaw: a column can¡¯t be moved after having been locked
4. Resolve the problem: user can unlock columns by right clicking with their mouse.
5. Support Theme (new for ver 2.1)
*** 
*** Alert: Ver 2.1 Or later only run in vfp9
*** 

History:
--- 2008-07-07
Add14-1: MergeHeader method can Designated new header height. If value Equivalent to -1 or not designated, The average allocation grid's headerheight.
Add14-2: If change header height in runtime, try move mouse to The bottom left corner
	Note:When you restore header height to the average allocation grid's headerheight. Hold down the adjustment of the high and move up, and let the mouse out of from grid. If you want to adjust the merger is all out of the height, please release the mouse before the press the Ctrl keyboard letting go, until the completion of adjustment.
Add14-3: Use \n as the line breaks. If you need the characters, use \\n.
Add14-4: Add property _FontName, _FontSize, _FontStyle, _BackColor, _ForeColor And _Align, When you combined the head when the head table will default to this property,Cancel the original header from the first row of the set.

Add13-1: can be edited directly part property in gird's header
	Property list: Caption, ForeColor, FontName, FontSize, FontBold, FontItalic, FontStrikethru, FontUnderline
	Note: When lTheme = .T., ForeColor there is no role.
Fix13-1: very sorry very serious mistake, when lTheme With .T., class title no refresh.

Add11-1: Support Theme.

--- 2008-06-24
Fix10-1: When close Grid.RecordSource and remove ManyHeader, form can't be destroy.

--- 2008-06-20
Add9-1: Bindevent column's Width£¬you can changed the column width in program.
Fix9-1: That some less important results.

--- 2008-06-18
Fix8-1: Repair use the right mouse button lock out, if the column was away, this judgement should be locked out several errors

--- 2008-06-17

--- 2008-05-04
Add4-1: Add Hidden Property "ClassLibraryRoot", now you can drag and drop or Derivative it into other class library files, But I hope the name of each class you derived is not the same.

--- 2008-04-28
Fix3-1: User can drag and drop any column that unlocked and can moved into area that locked by custom property nMinLock ,even user had set custom property nMinLock.

--- 2008-04-21

Fix1-3: Columns can't AutoFit when double click mouse on upper left corner of grid.(thank to dkfdtf)


Crucial£º
1. While container is be draw,at runtime,every Column of grid will be add two custom property:nIndex and aRefHeaders.
   while you use this class,if you had define same property in your column,it's possible that some error occurred.
2. container that include grid will be add instance of this class after grid was splited.
3. Form will be add a object that it name is __UnLockScreen at runtime.
   While you use this class,if you had same name object in form,it's possible that some error occurred.
4. For different styles,so,members of every header(LineTop,LineBottom,LineLeft,LineRight,Header1)can be free to set property.

To solve:
1. Screen will be locked when user click on horizontal scroll bar.so,you can't drag horizontal scrool bar,and the state of horizontal scroll bar will be display in time.
2. Column will be locked on the right.
3. user will have to write arbitrarya codes in Valid when Grid.AllowCellSelection = .F.
4. support skin
5. Class instance will disappearance when grid was unsplite after grid was splite.

stipulation:
1. In the following text,ManyHeader is the name of class instance that in form.
2. In the following text,grid is object that will always pass to custom method HeaderInit.
3. In the following text,column? is one column of grid.
4. In the following text,ColumnOrder is property of column.
5. In the following text,Header is member of ManyHeader.
6. In the following text,form is object that include ManyHeader and grid.

Note:
	*-- Group header will can't move if all of columns that in a group is set to movable = .F. .
	*-- Group header will can't resize if all of columns that in a group is set to resizable = .F. .
	*-- The difference between the width because of resize group header will be shared in every column of group.The width of The last column will include remainder that not be sharing.

	*-- Property that added at runtime for Grid.Column
	Column.nIndex		Numeric. Index of grid.column
	Column.aRefHeaders 	array object,point to corresponding header.
                                      When you have more than a ManyHeader for same grid,Array dimension will increase.


	*-- Note for subobject of header
	*-- Header is a container.its property can be set up.
	Header.nType 		Numeric. Type of header: 0 - general header,1 - header in group,2 - group header
	Header.lMovable 	Logical. Whether the columns can be moved.its value is Grid.Column.Movable in defalut.
	Header.lResizable 	Logical. Whether the columns can be resize.its value is Grid.Column.Resizable in default.

	Header.oRefup		Object.It can be point to group header for member of group.For group header or general header,its value is Null.
	Header.aRefColumns 	Arry object.You can enumerate column member compared to grid.for group header,you can have some members.
	*-- subobject of header
	Header.HeaderSort(0|1)
	*-- Describe : It can be use to group header only.to sort members by current ColumnOrder
	*-- Parameter:
		* 0			ascending
		* 1			descending
	*-- Remarks:Members of the order will be very frequent adjustments while header was moved.To ensure that the order is expected, please sort before enumerate members.




	Others......
	*-- Type of oheader in event
	Do Case
	Case toHeader.nType = 0
		*-- Object is general header
	Case toHeader.nType = 1
		*-- Object is header in group
	Case toHeader.nType = 2
		*-- Object is group header
	EndCase


	1. Caption of general header is Grid.Column.Header.Caption after InitHeader,you can use object that have same caption of Grid.Column.Header and set up property .
		Samples: 
			Form.ManyHeader.Column1.Header1.Caption = "New Caption"
			Form.ManyHeader.Column1.BackColor = Rgb(255, 0, 0)

	2. oRefHeader that new added in every columns will point to corresponding object of class.
		Samples: 
			Form.Grid.Column1.oRefHeader.Caption = "New Caption"
			Form.Grid.Column1.oRefHeader.BackColor = Rgb(255, 0, 0)

	3. Caption of group will be Sys(2015) also.If you don't save group,then,you can find this object by oRefup only.
		Sample1:
			lo = Form.ManyHeader.MergeHeader(1, 2, "New group")
			lo.Caption = "NewGroup2"
			--or--
			Form.ManyHeader.Column1.oRefup.Caption = "NewGroup2"
			--or--
			Form.Grid.Column1.aRefHeaders[1].oRefup.Caption = "NewGroup2"
		Sample2:
			lo = Form.ManyHeader.MergeHeader(1, 2, "New group")
			lo.Name = "NewHeader"
			Form.ManyHeader.NewHeader.Caption = "NewGroup2"

	4. All object of columns can be find by enumerate array aRefColumns of group.
		Samples:
			For Each loColumn In Form.ManyHeader.Column1.oRefup.aRefColumns
				? loColumn.ControlSource
			EndFor

	5. ALL header that corresponding columns can be find by enumerate array aRefHeaders of group.
		Samples:
			For Each lo In Form.Grid.Column1.aRefHeaders
				? lo.Caption = "Rename all header caption"
			EndFor

	6. You can rename Grid.column.header.caption in runtime,but,caption of header in class will be not rename never.

	7. You can't add/deleted columns in grid at runtime.in this case,please use HeaderInit().
