* Added link to Issues page for GoFish Classic (at bottom left of main form).

### GoFish Classic 5.2.01 - Released 2024-02-02

#### Enhancements
* The "Code Only" checkbox filter has been enhanced to find matches in some places previously ignored. It now also includes code matches found:
    * In #Define statements
    * In MNX files in `Command`, `Procedure`, or `SkipFor` fields
    * In FRX files in `Field` records (`ObjType = 8`)
* New checkbox filter "Comments Only" has been added.

* The Code View pane for matches in MNX files has been enhanced to be more descriptive.

* When opening a code window to edit, the match to the search text is highlighted.  (This code originally implemented in GoFish6 and replicated here)
* Colors in the Code View pane match the user's own colors in code windows. (Experimental)
* Removed confusing "match anywhere" checkbox in filter form; it always matches anywhere.
* Controls in the Options form referring to planned enhancements in GoFish6 have been removed.

#### Bug fixes
* When the match is to a file name of a text file (such as a PRG), the Code View pane shows the text correctly.  Previously the beginning text was lost.
* Highlighting (red box) around "Whole Word" now refreshes properly.

* Fixed: When the results are shown and the order of the results is changed by clicking the header of column "Proccode", "Statement" or "Code" then the error "SQL: ORDER BY clause in invalid" was thrown. This was fixed by also excluding these columns in the functions "SortColumn" and "SortColumSecondary".

* Fixed: On clicking "Edit" to open the file of the selected result could lead to error "Variable 'CR' is not found.".
* Fixed: For results that are part of a class-container and used in a form with a formset GF showed a wrong "name" (or you may call it "path") in the results.
* Improved: When clicking "Edit" to open a form or class of the selected result and this file could not be opened then nothing happened. From now on GF will tell you that the file can´t be opened and why not.
