### GoFish Classic 5.2.01 - Released 2024-02-02

    * In #Define statements
    * In MNX files in `Command`, `Procedure`, or `SkipFor` fields
    * In FRX files in `Field` records (`ObjType = 8`)
* New checkbox filter "Comments Only" has been added.

* The Code View pane for matches in MNX files has been enhanced to be more descriptive.

* When opening a code window to edit, the match to the search text is highlighted.  (This code originally implemented in GoFish6 and replicated here)
* Colors in the Code View pane match the user's own colors in code windows. (Experimental)
* Removed confusing "match anywhere" checkbox in filter form; it always matches anywhere.
* Controls in the Options form referring to planned enhancements in GoFish6 have been removed.

#### Bug fixes
* When the match is to a file name of a text file (such as a PRG), the Code View pane shows the text correctly.  Previously the beginning text was lost.
* Highlighting (red box) around "Whole Word" now refreshes properly.

* Improved: When clicking "Edit" to open a form or class of the selected result and this file could not be opened then nothing happened. From now on GF will tell you that the file canÂ´t be opened and why not.
